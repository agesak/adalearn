# Many companies have password requirements (must include a letter, a number and a symbol
# for example and require a password of a specific length). We're going to write a program
# that will read in a proposed password and only accept it, if it meets all rules.

# Create a program that will:

# Prompt a user for input (for a new password) (done)
# Read in the proposed Password to a variable (done)
# If the password contains a number and a symbol (@, %, *, or !) and contains 8 or more characters (done)
# then accept the password and congratulate the user, if not make them reenter the password until they enter an acceptable password (done)
# [Optional] Make the user enter the password a second time to verify, and if it's not the same as the original password, make them repeat the process (attempted)
# [Optional] Make them include a capital and a lowercase letter (done)
# [Optional] Let them know what they did wrong (done)
