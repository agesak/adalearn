# Unit 2
# Practice
# Q: For practice Create a loop in which outputs all the even numbers from 0 - 10

# A:
# so this isnt a loop
(0..10).step(2).to_a

# Another A:
# but this is!
(0..10).each do |num|
	if num == 0
		puts num
	elsif num % 2 == 0
		puts num
	end
end

# Example solution:
num = 0

while num <= 10
  puts num
  num += 2
end

# Exercises
# Q1
# Prompt for a number. If the number is greater than 70,
# print PASSING, otherwise, print NOT PASSING.

# Prompt for a string. If the string is equal to green,
# print GO, otherwise, print STOP.

# Prompt for a one of the following: SHORT, TALL, GRANDE, VENTI.
# Print out the number of ounces that drink includes
# (8, 12, 16, 20 respectively).

# Q8
# Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay.
# Provide time-and-a-half for hours worked beyond 40 (e.g.,
# if you get paid $10/hr and work 45 hours in a week,
# you would gross $475 (40 x 10 + 5 x 15).

# Rewrite the solution to the previous problem adding this modification:

# instead display the message Please see manager.
